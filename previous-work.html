<p>
  H1. is a platform that enables pharmaceutical companies quicker and cheaper access to key medical expert
  identification and analysis. Historically, this process has been slow, expensive, lacking information / quality, and
  nearly always results in data that is out of date as soon as it's delivered.
  H1. saw a need for a better solution, and over the past year and a half, that's exactly what we've built.


  Challenges faced:
  We're searching across hundreds of thousands of profiles and millions of scholarly artifacts in real time
  Dealing with the IT policies of pharmaceutical companies, couldn't store search state in the URL. had to use local
  storage.

  Scholarly Disambiguation is the data backbone of medical expert profiles on H1. In order to create comprehensive
  expert profiles, we needed to know
  every individual's publications authored, clincial trials led, open payments received, etc. There are publicly
  available sources that help, but there is no single source of truth for all the information we were after.
  We built a pipeline to automate this data collection for us with a remarkably high degree of accuracy.


  Supervised machine learning problem

  Challenges faced:
  parallelizing feature creation
  migrating to scala /spark when python proof of concept couldnt carry the weight anymore

  Labspot is a learning management system designed specifically for the needs of Medical Schools' scholarly projects
  curricula. Historically, collaboration between students and their faculty mentors went untracked, assignments were
  submitted via email and subject to slow feedback times, and a student taking a leave of absense would create
  chaos as disconnected spreadsheets had to be painstakingly updated.
  Labspot aimed to streamline these workflows to allow administrators and students to be more informed, and
  more organized, with less headaches.

  Challenges faced:
  constantly changing requirements

  Gojuki is a project I made for fun. It's a similar idea to "Hungry Hungry Hippos", except its beetles scavanging for
  food. You play with up to 3 other people on your local network, and compete for the highest score, and bragging
  rights.
