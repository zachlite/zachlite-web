<h1 class="mini">I build software that delights users, validates hypothesis, improves outcomes, and lowers costs.</h1>

<br />

<p><b>I solve problems.</b> You can do a Google search for snippets of code, but Google can't tell you how to think.</p>
<p><b>I avoid complexity.</b> There's a perpetual maintence cost for each line of code written.</p>
<p><b>I am language / stack agnostic.</b> Rock solid engineering principles donâ€™t go out of style.</p>
<p><b>I understand the user.</b> Software should be lovingly crafted for humans, not injection molded for robots.</p>
<p><b>I work quickly.</b> The world is highly competitive.</p>
