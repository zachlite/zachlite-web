<h1 class="mini">I engineer stuff.</h1>

<p>I build software that delights users, validates hypothesis, improves outcomes and lowers costs.</p>
<p>I solve problems. Google shows you snippets of code but it can’t tell you how to think.</p>
<p>I avoid complexity. There's a maintence cost for each line of code written.</p>
<p>I am language / stack agnostic. Rock solid engineering principles don’t go out of style.</p>
<p>I understand the user. Software should be lovingly crafted for humans, not injection molded for robots.</p>
<p>I work quickly. The world is highly competitive.</p>
