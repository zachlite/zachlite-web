  description: "H1. is a platform that enables pharmaceutical companies quicker and cheaper access to key medical expert
  identification and analysis via 750K clinicians and physicians, 50M publications, and 250K clinical trials.  Historically, this process has been slow, expensive, lacking information / quality, and
  nearly always results in data that is out of date as soon as it's delivered.
  H1. addresses these problems by providing information and analysis through a slick user interface at a fraction of the cost."

  description: "Scholarly Disambiguation enables the data backbone of medical expert profiles on H1. In order to create comprehensive
  expert profiles, we needed to know
  every individual's publications authored, clincial trials led, open payments received, etc. There are publicly
  available sources that help, but there is no single source of truth for all the information we were after.
  We built a supervised machine learning pipeline and achieved a remarkably high degree of accuracy."

  time: June 2016 - June 2017
  description: "  Labspot is a learning management system designed specifically for the needs of Medical Schools' scholarly projects
  curricula. Historically, collaboration between students and their faculty mentors went untracked, assignments were
  submitted via email and subject to slow feedback times, and a student taking a leave of absense would create
  chaos as disconnected spreadsheets had to be painstakingly updated.
  Labspot aimed to streamline these workflows to allow administrators and students to be more informed, and
  more organized, with less headaches."
